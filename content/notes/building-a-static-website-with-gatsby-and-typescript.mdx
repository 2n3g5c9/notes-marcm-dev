# Context

## Motivation

* Keep up with React/TypeScript core concepts, and understand modern front-end web development workflows.
* Maintain basic knowledge of web design, but without the overhead of writing layers of wrapper components.
* Experiment with a web analytics tool, and understand what kind of insights can be derived.

## Requirements

* Top-notch performance on all pages, no matter where the reader is: on all continents... or in the Tube.
* Free hosting, since there is no need for server-side logic and low traffic is expected.
* High security standards, because everyone should care.
* Acceptable level of accessibility, to include all readers regardless of disabilities.
* Automated dependency updates (not recommended in production), to minimise my time in JavaScript dependency hell.
